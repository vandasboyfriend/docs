Once the installation is complete, you can run Vision from the Programs folder.

## Installing on Linux

The Vision application for Linux devices is in .AppImage format and runs as an executable file. No installation is required.

After extracting the application file from the downloaded archive, you will be able to run it as a normal application.

### Can't executing file like a programm

In order to run the application file, you need to grant the appropriate permissions using the context menu of your operating system, or using the **Terminal** application

#### How to change application permissions by context menu?

Extract the .AppImage file from the downloaded archive and right-click on it, select Properties in the context menu. In the window that opens, select the Permissions tab and tick the Allow executing file as a program check box.

#### How to change application permissions by terminal application?

Open the Terminal application and navigate to the folder where the extracted .AppImage application file is located (for example, this folder is called Downloads)

```
cd ~/Downloads
```

Next, run the chmod command to change the permissions of the file named **vision_2.5.33_amd64.AppImage**

```
chmod +x vision_2.5.33_amd64.AppImage
```
