## Mail confirming

Once you click the "Sign Up" button on the filled-out form, an email containing a confirmation code for your account will be sent to your email address, and a confirmation code input window will appear on the screen.

<Note>
    If you don't find the email in your inbox, please check your spam folder as this is a common issue. If you still can't find the email, you can contact our support team via [Telegram](https://t.me/visionsupportbot) or by widget on [browser.vision](https://browser.vision), and we will quickly resolve this issue for you.

**There are two ways to confirm your account:**
### Confirmation via code

After clicking the "Sign Up" button, an email with the confirmation code has been sent to your email address. Copy the code from the email and paste it into the confirmation modal window that has appeared.
